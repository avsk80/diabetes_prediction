Diabetes prediction using machine learning

data description: The following features have been provided to help us predict whether a person is diabetic or not:

1)Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

2)Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

general info :Before glucose intake (fasting): 5.3 mmol/L (95 mg/dL) 1 hour after drinking the glucose solution: 10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) 2 hours: 8.6 mmol/L (155 mg/dL) 3 hours: 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL)

3)BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

general info: ideal blood pressure is considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg. high blood pressure is considered to be 140/90mmHg or higher. low blood pressure is considered to be 90/60mmHg or lower.

4)SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

general info: makes skin thinner

5)Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

6)BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)2)

7)DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history)

8)Age: Age (years)

9)Outcome: Class variable (0 if non-diabetic, 1 if diabetic)

Used logistic regression model to classify the outcome with an accuracy of 81%
